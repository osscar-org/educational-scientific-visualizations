# Educational scientific visualization

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of interesting interactive visualizations
for a student audience, aiming at making it simpler to understand advanced
concepts with the aid of interactive visualizations.

This repository will be enriched over time with more visualizations and more disciplines.

## Available visualizations
### Mathematics

### Physics

- [Impact distance of a projectile](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/osscar-org/widget-code-input/master?urlpath=apps/demos/projectile-inline.ipynb) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/osscar-org/widget-code-input/master?urlpath=apps/demos/projectile-inline.ipynb) <br> (developed within the [OSSCAR](http://www.osscar.org) project, funded by the EPFL Open Science Fund)


## Technical notes on the tools used
To allow for interactive visualizations, a number of tools are used, in particular:

- [jupyter](http://jupyter.org) to provide interactive notebooks
- [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for the widgets (dropdowns, sliders, ...)
- [bqplot](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot) for plotting
- [appmode](https://github.com/oschuett/appmode/) to convert a standard jupyter notebook into a "web app"
- [voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) another popular tool to convert a standard jupyter notebook into a "web app"
- [mybinder](https://mybinder.org) to open notebooks on the web
